# Lua to x86 compiler in JavaScript

Ever wanted to know how compilers work? This is a good way to learn about what happens under the hood of a compiler.

This project implements a Lua to x86 assembly compiler in JavaScript. It uses a hand-rolled lexer, a recursive-descent parser, and emits x86 assembly. The result is a compiler for a small subset of Lua to basic x86 assembly.
